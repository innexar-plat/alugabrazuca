# Copilot Setup for BrasilQuartos

> Plataforma de aluguel de quartos nos EUA e Europa para brasileiros.
> Nome do projeto configurável via `APP_NAME` no `.env` (padrão: BrasilQuartos).

Follow this repository guidance in order:

1. .github/instructions/project-context.instructions.md ← **ler primeiro (identidade, arquitetura, regras)**
2. .github/instructions/\*.instructions.md (demais instruções técnicas)
3. .github/agents/\*.agent.md for specialized execution modes
4. .github/skills/\*/SKILL.md for domain playbooks
5. .github/rules/\* as supplemental operational frameworks

## Repository-Specific Directives

- Preserve Clean Architecture module boundaries in apps/api/src/modules.
- Keep API behavior aligned with .github/instructions/api-design.instructions.md.
- Enforce OWASP-oriented practices from security-owasp.instructions.md.
- Never hardcode the platform name — always use `process.env.APP_NAME` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`.
- Never hardcode colors — always use CSS tokens from `tokens.css`.
- Never hardcode text strings — always use i18n keys from next-intl.
- Add or update tests for backend/frontend changes and keep behavior verifiable.
- Prefer small, targeted edits over broad refactors.
- All infrastructure runs via Docker Compose (see docker-compose.yml at project root).

## Mandatory Modular Workflow

- Before starting any product module work, always read these files in this order:
  1.  docs/01-foundation/construction-method.md
  2.  docs/01-foundation/module-delivery-checklist.md
  3.  docs/01-foundation/module-handoff-template.md
  4.  docs/modules/<current-module>/README.md
  5.  docs/handoffs/<previous-module-handoff>.md, when it exists
- Before acting on any generic prompt such as `continue`, `continue module`, `avance`, or similar, the AI must recompute the next module from source files, not from chat memory or summaries.
- The next module must be determined by this checkpoint, in order:
  1.  read `docs/01-foundation/construction-method.md`
  2.  list files in `docs/handoffs/`
  3.  compare the official module order against existing handoffs
  4.  pick the first module in the official order that does not yet have a completed handoff
  5.  only then open that module README and start work
- Never infer the next module only from the latest conversational summary, an open editor tab, or the last module mentioned in chat.
- If the official order and the existing handoffs diverge, the AI must stop following the accidental sequence and resume from the first missing module in the official order.
- Work one module at a time. Do not open or partially implement multiple modules in parallel.
- A module is not considered complete until documentation, API contract, data model, implementation, minimum automated tests, and handoff are all updated.
- If a module changes the database schema, the AI must create and apply the migration in the same advance before considering the module or step complete.
- Never implement endpoints, tables, or flows without first updating the module documentation.
- Never leave schema changes pending for a later step; every database change must ship with its matching migration and be recorded in the module README or handoff.
- When finishing a module, always produce a handoff package that states: what was delivered, which endpoints exist, which entities/tables were created, which business rules are now active, what remains pending, and what the next module may assume as ready.
- Before finishing a module, always run a completeness review covering UI web, API, database, app impact, shared components, error/loading/empty states, authorization, tests, documentation, and handoff.
- If a task touches an existing module, the AI must read that module's README and preserve alignment with its documented scope before editing code.
